# Yoga-Posture-Correction-Feedback-Google_MediaPipe

Developed a computer vision system to provide real-time feedback on yoga postures by processing images to extract 33 body landmarks with MediaPipe and calculating 8 key biomechanical angles. Trained and evaluated multiple ”specialist” machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost) for ten unique poses, achieving a peak accuracy of over 93% and proving the specialist approach superior to a single global model.
